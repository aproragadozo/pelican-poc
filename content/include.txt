# A header, for no real reason

This is some content that I'd like to include in some other files:

![alt-text]({filename}img/test-image.jpg)

Let's see if code works:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
```
